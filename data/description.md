# Interactive phylogeny of early SARS-CoV-2 that attempts to reproduce Fig 3a of 2024 study by group of Yong-Zhen Zhang
This tree is designed to reproduce that in Fig. 3a of [Lv et al, Virus Evolution (2024)](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/10/1/veae020/7619252), which reports a phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in previously in public databases and new sequences collected by Zhang's group from what Zhang calls "stages 0 and 1" of the outbreak (before March-1-2020).

The phylogeny here was built by trying to exactly reproduce the methods of [Lv et al, Virus Evolution (2024)](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/10/1/veae020/7619252) used to make Fig. 3a of that paper, so see that paper for details about the sequences included, their lineage designations, rooting of the tree, etc.
However, the methods were not sufficient to completely reproduce every detail, so the tree here is very close but may not be exactly identical to that from the paper.
In addition to the metadata from [Lv et al, Virus Evolution (2024)](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/10/1/veae020/7619252), sequences noted as being from 2019 in Tables 6 and 7 of the [joint WHO-China report](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-convened-global-study-of-origins-of-sars-cov-2-china-part) are also annotated on this phylogeny.

Note that the best way to root the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny is still an open topic with substantial uncertainty (see [Pipes et al (2021)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/4/1537/6028993)).
There are also open questions about the best way to subsample, de-duplicate, and quality control early SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Further, the high similarity of the sequences mean there is also just limited statistical support to reliably draw conclusions about some aspects of the phylogeny (see the [paper "Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data is difficult" by Morel et al (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/5/1777/6030946)).

This phylogeny attempts to reproduce the one from the study by Zhang's group ([Lv et al, Virus Evolution (2024)](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/10/1/veae020/7619252)) since that is the most recent major study on the topic and includes additional sequence data not in prior analyses.
However, further work on rooting and sequence curation are needed (this phylogeny should help with that), and recall the conclusion of [Pipes et al (2021)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/4/1537/6028993) that _"These results suggest that phylogenetic evidence alone is unlikely to identify the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and we caution against strong inferences regarding the early spread of the virus based solely on such evidence."_

The code used to build this phylogeny is available [in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/jbloom/rebuild_Lv_SARS2_tree).
